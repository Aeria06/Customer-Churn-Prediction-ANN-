# Customer-Churn-Prediction-ANN-
Customer Churn Prediction using ANN identifies customers likely to leave a service by analyzing historical data such as demographics, account details, and usage behavior. An Artificial Neural Network is trained using encoded and scaled features to model complex patterns,  improve customer retention strategies.

🎯 Objectives

Predict whether a customer will churn or not

Learn customer behavior patterns using ANN

Build a reusable and deployable ML pipeline

🧠 Model Description

The ANN model is trained on preprocessed customer data that includes both numerical and categorical features.

Categorical features are encoded using One-Hot Encoding

Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler

The model uses Binary Cross-Entropy loss and Adam optimizer

Early Stopping is applied to prevent overfitting

git clone <repository-url>
cd Customer-Churn-Prediction-ANN

2️⃣ Create & Activate Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Train the Model

Run the training notebook or script to train the ANN model and save the trained artifacts.

5️⃣ Make Predictions

Load the saved model, scaler, and encoders to predict customer churn on new data.

💾 Model Artifacts

Trained ANN model (.keras / .h5)

Scaler (scaler.pkl)

Encoders (onehot_encoder.pkl)

📈 Results

The model achieves good accuracy on validation data and effectively identifies customers at risk of churn.
